# CS_530_FinalProject

To run either download our submitted zip folder and unzip it or you can clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/aczapata/CS_530_FinalProject.git

Once you are in the project folder, simply run the planets.py file: python planets.py

Some info about pytwobodyorbit. We initially pip installed pytwobodyorbit, however we decided to download it locally and include it here so that no external modules are needed.
